## Time Spent

**How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?**

> I’m not exactly sure how many hours it took, but I started working on it Friday evening and continued throughout Saturday and Sunday. I still feel like my work isn’t quite where I want it to be—especially in terms of styling.

## Challenges

**Were there any parts of the lab you found challenging?**

> Yes, the most challenging part was managing data coming from different sources (search API vs random API), especially when handling missing fields like `summary` or `readyInMinutes` for random recipes. Also, making sure data was passed correctly between pages (especially from favorites to details) needed careful debugging.
