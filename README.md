## Time Spent

**How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?**

> I’m not exactly sure how many hours it took, but I started working on it Friday morning and continued throughout Saturday and Sunday. I still feel like my work isn’t quite where I want it to be—especially in terms of styling.

## Challenges

**Where there any parts of the lab you found challenging?**

> Yes, the most challenging part was managing data coming from different sources (search API vs random API), especially when handling missing fields like summary or readyInMinutes for random recipes. Also, making sure data was passed correctly between pages (especially from favorites to details) needed careful debugging. Additionally, setting up and interacting with the database added complexity—particularly when saving and retrieving favorite recipes, ensuring data consistency, and handling potential errors during database operations In part 3, the most difficult thing I encountered was deploying, since my website still has an issue that I couldn't solve.
